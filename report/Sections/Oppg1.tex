\section{Task 1}
We wish to look at reaction-diffusion equations, which have the form
$$ u_t = \mu u_{xx} + f(u)$$
where $\mu$ is a positive constant. We also assume that the reaction term, $f(u)$ is non-stiff, such that explicit methods can be used to solve $u_t = f(u)$.
We discretize the domain in both space and time, such that $x_m = x_0 + m*h, \quad t_n = t_0 + n*k$.
A scheme based on forward and backward Euler, together with a central difference in space, could be:
$$ \frac{1}{k}\nabla_tU_{m}^{n+1}=\frac{\mu}{h^2}\delta_x^2U_{m}^{n+1}+f(U_{m}^{n} )$$
which can be rewritten to 
$$U_{m}^{n+1} = U_{m}^{n} + r (U_{m+1}^{n+1}-2U_{m}^{n+1}+U_{m-1}^{n+1}) + kf(U_{m}^{n}), \quad r = \mu\frac{k}{h^2}$$
Time dependent PDEs should be solved using implicit methods. This requires solving a linear system for each step. We wish to avoid this, by using an implicit method for the diffusion term and an explicit method for the reaction term.
This could be solved be using the scheme
\begin{align*}
    U_{m}^{*} =& U_{m}^{n} +\frac{r}{2}(\delta_x^2 U_{m}^{*} + \delta_x^2 U_{m}^{n} ) + kf(U_{m}^{n}) \\
    U_{m}^{n+1} =& U_{m}^{*} + \frac{k}{2}(f(U_{m}^{*}) - f(U_{m}^{n}))
\end{align*}
